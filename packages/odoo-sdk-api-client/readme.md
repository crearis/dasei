# About the Odoo-SDK-Api-Client

by: Hans

The original source-code-repo is only accessible via npmjs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@erpgap/odoo-sdk-api-client

We work with version 0.7.2.

As the original source-code-repo is protected by VSFEL-Licence no changes in the code-logic should be done!

But: we need to fix outdated imports (Axios > was fixed to 0.3.x!!) and incompatible import-strategies that don't alter the logic of the code.
Here is a temporary place to document core functionality and issues to decide on further strategies
